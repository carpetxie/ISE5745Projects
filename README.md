**These are the machine learning projects from ISE5745, a graduate-level course at The Ohio State University on the foundations and applications of ML**

These projects explore core machine learning techniques with hands-on implementations using scikit-learn, including:

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifiers, and Linear Regression models.
2. Advanced data preprocessing techniques like featurization, discretization, and binning of continuous data spaces.
3. Explorations of clustering algorithms and custom-built regression functions derived purely from mathematical principles, without relying on pre-built libraries.
4. Covered supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
5. Implementing OpenAI Gym libraries

One standout project involved designing an algorithm to visualize RGB pixel values from images in a 3D space, using KNN to classify colors by their RGB coordinates and segment them into a distinct set of k colors.
